# Cool Compiler

A compiler for the Cool language, which I am developing for the Compilers course of my Computer Science degree.

I'm using [PLY](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) for the lexical analysis.


# Phases of Compilation

In progress
- lexical analysis

Soon

- syntax analysis
- semantic analysis
- code generation

# How to run

Install PLY
```console
pip install ply
```

Generate and print tokens
```console
python cool_lex.py cool_files/cool.cl
```
